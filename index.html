      <p>I am a Full-Stack Engineer, currently looking for an opportunity to make impact and grow in a tech-first company where problems need to be solved at scale. I have experience in working with Web Technologies and lately I have been roaming in the realm of Machine Learning trying to grasp how it can help us iterate and improve upon our web applications and services.</p>
